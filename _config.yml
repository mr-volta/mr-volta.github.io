  Hi, I'm Mr Volta, a musician and producer based in Belgium.<br><br>

  Born in Antwerp in 1991. Started playing saxophone at an early age. Picked up computer software to make music and fell in love.<br><br>

  At the age of 17 I released my first EP under USA Import Music.<br><br>

  After this experience went to study free arts at KASK & Conservatorium / School of Arts Gent and wasn't really making much music because my focus was on making visuals.<br><br>

  But the love for sound never went away and after finishing my Bachelor I really felt the urge to get back to my adventure of making electronic music.<br><br>

  Trying out different stuff like HipHop and picking up a jazz flute.<br><br>

  I cover everything from Hip-hop &amp; Rap to Jazz & Blues, to Dance & EDM, to Dubstep, Dubtechno, Triphop, House, Techno,...<br><br>

  Catch me on the net&#58;<br>
